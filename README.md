The Decarbonization Imperative for C&A: An Expert Analysis of Emissions, Projections, and Strategic Pathways to Leadership

This report provides an in-depth, expert-level analysis of C&A's carbon footprint, offering a comprehensive review of its historical performance, a critical evaluation of industry data, and a forward-looking projection of its emissions trajectory. The central objective is to present a strategic roadmap for C&A to not only meet but to exceed its sustainability targets, positioning the company as a leader in the global fashion industry's transition to a low-carbon economy.
The analysis reveals that C&A has made significant progress in its decarbonization efforts, achieving a nearly 32% reduction in its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its 2018 baseline to 2022, demonstrating a clear commitment to its stated sustainability goals. A detailed breakdown of the company's emissions data confirms that the vast majority of its carbon footprint—over 96%—is concentrated in Scope 3 emissions, primarily from purchased goods and services. This finding underscores that the most critical and impactful area for future reduction lies deep within its supply chain, beyond the company's direct operational control.
